My first assignment has three parts.

## (a)

In that part, I watched a conference talk (<https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/talks/develop-deploy-python-rstudio/>) related to Model Building and Deployment in R.\
Firstly, I chose the conference talk because I thought that we could use R software language only to examine the data, make mathematical operations more understandable and faster. As I learned from the conference, we can perform not only these operations, but also more advanced operations.\
In even more detail, they said that model building and model deployment processes can be even performed in R via programs like Workbench and Shiny.\
To sum up, Workbench enables idle's such as VSCode and Jupyter to work in integration with the R program, the Shiny program is used to report the output of the model in the web interface and to design an interactive web interface.

## (b) 3 Differences between R and Python Languages

The biggest between them is creators. The constructors of the R programming language are statisticians, the constructors of Python are not.

```{i = i + 1 #in python, we use this for loop and while functions to get this step or variable to the next step. which means a counter}
```

```{i <- i + 1 #in r, we can assign the variable like that}

```

The other difference is that Python is an Objected-Oriented Program but R is a Functional Programming Language.

Last difference is that Python can run faster than R generally but R is optimized for statistical operations and can perform efficient operations on large data sets.

## (c) dslabs, replacing missing values to 0

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(na_example)
na_example
```


```{r}
data <- na_example
data[is.na(data)] <-0
data
```
